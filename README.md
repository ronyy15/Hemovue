**Hemorrhage Detection from Brain CT Scans using Machine Learning**

**HemoVue** is an AI-driven solution for detecting brain hemorrhages from CT scan images. By combining imaging features with patient demographics, it improves diagnostic accuracy using multiple machine learning models.

---

## Highlights

* Trained and compared 6 ML models:
  Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Network
* **Top performers:** XGBoost and Neural Network
* Metrics: Accuracy, Log Loss, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Dataset includes labeled CT scans for binary classification (hemorrhage / no hemorrhage)
